# Maven Clean Install

<br>

This repository trains you in how to solve errors in the code. For every task below there is an error, and by first running the application (through the tests in the `reference-component-test` module) an error will be shown.

With help of this error you go through the application and find what is wrong. For each task, there is only one error. A little further ahead there will be tasks that have more than one error.
